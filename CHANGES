Revision history for Perl extension GraphViz2::Marpa.

1.04  Wed Sep 12 11:11:00 2012
	- Add GraphViz2::Marpa::Parser::TreeUtils with method fixed_length_paths(), together with
		scripts/fixed.length.paths.pl and scripts/fixed.length.paths.sh (which just runs *.pl).
		This parses a DOT file and finds all paths of a given length starting from a given node.
	- Hence added dependency Tree::DAG_Node, whose only dependencies are Carp, strict and vars.
	- Add t/fixed.length.paths.t to test the new code.
	- Add data/fixed.length.paths.gv as output from scripts/fixed.length.paths.sh.
	- Add html/fixed.length.paths.svg likewise.
	- Add html/fixed.length.paths.html to demonstrate the output of the new code.
	- See http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/graphviz2.marpa/fixed.length.paths.html.

1.03  Mon Sep  3 09:28:00 2012
	- Remove unused dependency Module::UseFrom.
	- Fix disastrous bug in the parser. Test with data/90.Petersen.dot.
	- Add README.
	- Rename scripts/generate.demo.pl to scripts/generate.index.pl, since it does not run all demos,
		it just creates html/index.html.
	- Add FAQ item in GraphViz2::Marpa about how to re-create demo files.

1.02  Fri Jun 22 11:50:00 2012
	- Patch the regexp in the DFA used to recognize HTML-style labels. It's smarter now.
	- Patch the default renderer to not add double-quote delimiters when outputting HTML-style labels.
		These patches require files (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38).dot to be edited.
		And they require files (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38).(lex, parse, rend) to be re-generated.
	- Add an item to both the lexer's and parser's FAQs about embedding things like <br ... /> in HTML-style labels.
	- Add an item to the lexer's FAQ about the 1 label format still not handled by the new code.
	- Change the format (spacing) of tokens printed in the lexer to match format used in the parser.
	- Update FAQ as to why setting report_items prints 2 copies of the tokens (Ans: 1 each for lexer and parser).

1.01  Wed Feb  8 11:22:00 2012
	  - Add a renderer attribute to the Marpa class, which gets passed to the parser.
	  	In Marpa.pm, this defaults to '' but in Parser.pm it defaults to a GraphViz2::Marpa::Renderer::GraphViz2 object.
	  - Expand docs relating to script options and class attributes.
	  - Update data/code.attributes.*.
