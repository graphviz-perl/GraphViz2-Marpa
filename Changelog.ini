Comments= <<EOT
- Fix a bug in the lexer where it used to combine multiple lines in the input file by, basically, using
join('', <IN>), which meant the last char of a line was juxtaposed with the first char of the next
line. If the second line started with spaces, that was ok, but if it started with, say, the name of
a node, then that name was concatenated with what could have been a node name on the end of a previous
line. This meant 2 separate node names sometimes became one.
- Add data/52.gv to test the solution.
- Shift data/code.attributes.html to html/.
- Shift data/default.stt.html to html/.

[V 1.04]

Comments= <<EOT
- All data/*.dot files were renamed to data/*.gv, in line with Graphviz itself.
- Design change. In the output streams from both the lexer and the parser, the 3 special tokens whose names
are edge, graph and node, were given the type node_id. Unfortunately, this is confusing because any
normal edge, graph or node was also given that type. Now, these 3 cases are of type class_id.
This makes it easier for code processing these output streams to distinguish between special cases
and common-or-garden nodes. It should have always been done this way, and specifically simplifies code
in GraphViz2::Marpa::TreeUtils.
- Change Marpa.pm to support the new distro GraphViz2::Marpa::TreeUtils, which is a sub-class of GraphViz2::Marpa.
Specifically, the lexer and the parser are stored in mutators called lexer() and parser(),
so they can be called from sub-classes.
- This means any shell scripts using -l now need -lexed_file, and if using -p now need -parsed_file.
- This in turns means patches to various scripts (scripts/*.sh and scripts/*.pl).
- The opportunity was taken to spell out all command line option names in shell scripts.
- Update POD to reflect these changes.

Comments= <<EOT
- Remove unused dependency Module::UseFrom.
- Fix disastrous bug in the parser. Test with data/90.Petersen.dot.
- Add README.
- Rename scripts/generate.demo.pl to scripts/generate.index.pl, since it does not run all demos,
it just creates html/index.html.
- Add FAQ item in GraphViz2::Marpa about how to re-create demo files.

[V 1.02]
Date=2012-06-22T11:50:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Patch the regexp in the DFA used to recognize HTML-style labels. It's smarter now.
- Patch the default renderer to not add double-quote delimiters when outputting HTML-style labels.
These patches require files (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38).dot to be edited.
And they require files (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38).(lex, parse, rend) to be re-generated.
- Add an item to both the lexer's and parser's FAQs about embedding things like <br ... /> in HTML-style labels.
- Add an item to the lexer's FAQ about the 1 label format still not handled by the new code.
- Change the format (spacing) of tokens printed in the lexer to match format used in the parser.
- Update FAQ as to why setting report_items prints 2 copies of the tokens (Ans: 1 each for lexer and parser).

[V 1.01]
Date=2012-02-08T11:22:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add a renderer attribute to the Marpa class, which gets passed to the parser.
In Marpa.pm, this defaults to '' but in Parser.pm it defaults to a GraphViz2::Marpa::Renderer::GraphViz2 object.
- Expand docs relating to script options and class attributes.
- Update data/code.attributes.*.
